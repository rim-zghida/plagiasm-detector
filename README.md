# 🛡️ Plagiarism & AI Detection System
## 🌟 Features

- **Semantic Plagiarism Detection**: Uses `pgvector` and `sentence-transformers` to detect similarities based on meaning, not just exact word matches.
- **AI-Generated Text Detection**: Detects content from GPT-3, GPT-4, and other models using local HuggingFace models, OpenAI's API, or **Together API**.
- **Smart Text Chunking**: Automatically splits long documents into overlapping chunks to ensure accurate analysis of large files.
- **Archive & Folder Support**: Upload `.zip`, `.tar`, or entire folders. The system extracts and filters relevant text files automatically.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Runs anywhere Docker is available (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with registration and login.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different access levels (user, moderator, admin).
- **Admin Dashboard**: System administration and user management interface.
- **Multi-User Support**: Full support for multiple concurrent users with data isolation.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide 

This guide is designed to get you up and running in minutes, regardless of your technical background.

### 1. Install Docker (One-time setup)
Docker is the engine that runs the application. Think of it like a "virtual machine" that contains everything the app needs.

### 2. Get the Code
- **Clone the repo**: `git clone https://github.com/rim-zghida/plagiasm-detector.git`


### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a copy of the example environment file:
```bash
cp backend/.env.docker.example backend/.env.docker
```

Edit `backend/.env.docker` to customize your installation:
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Email for the initial admin user (default: admin@example.com)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Password for the initial admin user (default: AdminPass123!)

### 4. Launch the App
1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux).
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd plagiarism-detection`
3. Run the command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```
4. Wait a few minutes for the first-time setup. Once finished, open your browser to:
   👉 **[http://localhost](http://localhost)**

### 5. Initial Setup
- On first startup, the system automatically creates:
  - Database tables
  - An admin user account (credentials from environment variables)
  - Sample user accounts for testing
- Use the admin credentials to log in and manage the system

   - Email: `ADMIN_EMAIL` (defaults to admin@example.com)
   - Password: `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (defaults to AdminPass123!)
3. **Sample Users**: Creates sample accounts for testing:
   - user1@example.com (password: UserPass123!)
   - user2@example.com (password: UserPass123!)
   - moderator@example.com (password: ModPass123!)
